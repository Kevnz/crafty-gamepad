Component for the [Crafty](http://craftyjs.com/) HTML5/JavaScript game engine for
handling input events of gamepad devices. Also contains a *GamepadMultiway*
component for moving an entity with a gamepad.

The [HTML5 Gamepad API](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/doodles/gamepad/)
is yet experimental and subject to change. Expect this code to break until the
Gamepad API is stable. So far has only been tested with Google Chrome and Xbox 360
controllers.
